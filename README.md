Component REST API Explorer - EXAMPLE COMPONENT 
===============================================
This component, lovingly titled "testing-project" behind the scenes, should allow you to do rudimentary REST API exploration from within UI Builder...but it's true purpose is to to demystify some of the idiosyncrasies of building components in UI Builder! 

This README will describe our file structure, tips and tricks, and the high-level "how-tos" and "whys" behind how we've built the component...each component is commented in line to explain what each component is doing, why, and if there's any considerations!
