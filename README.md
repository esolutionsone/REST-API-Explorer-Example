Component REST API Explorer - EXAMPLE COMPONENT 
===============================================
This component, lovingly titled "testing-project" behind the scenes, is intended not only to allow you to do rudimentary REST API exploration from within UI Builder but also intends to demistify some of the idiocyncricies of building components in UI Builder! 

This README will describe our file structure, why we've structured our files in this way, some tips and tricks, and the high level "how-tos"...each component is also commented to explain exactly what it's doing and why!
