Component REST API Explorer - EXAMPLE COMPONENT
===============================================

## Intro
This component, lovingly titled "testing-project" ðŸ¤” behind the scenes, should allow you to do rudimentary REST API exploration from within UI Builder...but its **true purpose is to demystify some of the idiosyncrasies of building components in UI Builder!**

This README will describe our **file structure, tips and tricks, and the high-level "how-tos" and "whys" behind how we've built the component** ðŸ™Œ

**each file is commented in-line** to explain what each component is doing, why, and if there are any considerations!

## How to use this component
Just use it dog

## File structure
    - src                                 âžœ Source code for our custom component!
        - x-71146-testing-project         âžœ Our Component (all custom code should be in here)
            - tests                       âžœ Component tests 
            - components                  âžœ Create a custom components folder that holds all sub-components
                - ChoiceInput             âžœ Folder containing all ChoiceInput component files
                - ResponseTable           âžœ Folder containing all ResponseTable component files
                - TextInput               âžœ Folder containing all TextInput component files
                - TypeAheadReference      âžœ Folder containing all TypeAheadReference component files
            - actionHandlers.js           âžœ Our actionHandlers handle dispatches and REST calls!
            - helper.js                   âžœ Our helper handles function calls in click, change, etc.
            - index.js                    âžœ This is our "core component"
            - styles.scss                 âžœ This is our core style sheet
        - index.js                        âžœ Wrapper for your custom component (don't touch ðŸ˜Š)

*For a project of this size and complexity we recommend defining a "Components" folder to contain any subcomponents to use in your "core" component, a helpers.js file, and an actionHandlers.js file. The helper file will contain helper functions to be used in your core and sub-components whereas the actionHandler will be used to manage dispatch requests and send REST messages.*

The Styles.scss file is your main SCSS file *any sub-component SCSS file should be included in this file & core component SCSS can be defined here

## Considerations

*Other folders that may be included in more complex projects:*

**Views**

This folder could be defined with various views within to display a different view dependent on the state. Views can be an invaluable tool to de-clutter / simplify your core component as it grows in scope or complexity

**Styles**

This folder could be defined with various style sheets to include in your main style sheet >> This could be a folder where your view styles (and potentially sub-component styles) could be defined >> This could make working with style sheets easier as they're all in one spot!
